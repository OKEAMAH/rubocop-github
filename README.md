# RuboCop GitHub ![CI](https://github.com/github/rubocop-github/workflows/CI/badge.svg?event=push)

This repository provides recommended RuboCop configuration and additional Cops for use on GitHub open source and internal Ruby projects.

## Usage

**Gemfile**

``` ruby
gem "rubocop-github"
gem "rubocop-performance", require: false
gem "rubocop-rails", require: false
```

**.rubocop.yml**

``` yaml
inherit_gem:
  rubocop-github:
    - config/default.yml
    - config/rails.yml
```

ðŸ’­ Looking for `config/accessibility.yml` and the `GitHub/Accessibility` configs? They have been moved to [a new gem](https://github.com/github/rubocop-rails-accessibility).

For more granular control over which of RuboCop's rules are enabled for your project, both from this gem and your own configs, consider using the `DisabledByDefault: true` option under `AllCops` in your project's `.rubocop.yml` file. This will disable all cops by default, and you can then explicitly enable the ones you want by setting `Enabled: true`. See [the RuboCop docs](https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/configuration.html#enabled) for more information.

### Legacy usage

If you are using a rubocop version < 1.0.0, you can use rubocop-github version
0.16.2 (see the README from that version for more details).

## Testing

``` bash
bundle install
bundle exec rake test
```

## The Cops

All cops are located under [`lib/rubocop/cop/github`](lib/rubocop/cop/github) and [`lib/rubocop/cop/github/accessibility`](lib/rubocop/cop/github/accessibility), and contain examples/documentation.
